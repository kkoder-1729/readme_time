# Sentiment Analysis on Connect and Perspectives


## Problem Statement

The problem domain is feedback analysis. 

The Connect tool is used for work updates and core priorities while the Perspectives is used for requesting feedbacks from the colleagues. So, the Connect tool is for Manager feedback while Perspectives is used for Peer feedback. Now, what this feedbacks aims at or what they are used for? The feedbacks are meant for improving the employee performance by giving the areas of improvement and their strong areas and also, for getting the performance report of an employee. The feedback needs to be well analyzed and understood for improving skills and increasing performance.

The problem with feedback analysis can be arised at team level or organisation level. A employee can analyze his/her feedback provided but when a manager or a team leader wants to analyse the performance of every employee of the team/org based on feedbacks (either at the term end or for appraisal) or when the HR wants to analyse interns performance based on feedbacks for their conversion, it can be tedious process to manually note down +ve and -ve points of every employee and analyze it or compare it if needed.

The solution to this problem can be addressed by generating a complete feedback analysis report of any employee stating the +ve and -ve feedbacks along with the +ve and -ve aspects mentioned. This can have a great impact on employee performance or skillset and by this way, the feedbacks are well utilized for improving the employees skills.


To approch the problem solution, the problem needs to be well analysed. Solution to the problem is to introduce Sentiment Analysis in the Connect and Perspectives tools using state of the art deep learning techniques which can give a best in class Aspect-level Sentiment Analysis of the feedbacks. The overall aim of the project is to classify the text based on its polarity score for having a better impact on connect info and perspective feedback review system.


## Aim

The project aims to introduce a Sentiment Analysis in Connect and Perspectives using deep learning frameworks. The analysis feature is aimed to provide the following three types of analysis:

a) Sentence Level Supervised Sentiment Analysis: Analyze feedbacks by finding the polarity of the text.

b) Aspect Level Supervised Sentiment Analysis (Entity/ Feature-level Sentiment Analysis): Analyze feedbacks by extracting the topics (aspects) and then evaluating the sentiment of each topic. Analyze feedback by evaluating the sentiment of multiple entities present in the feedback. 

c) Unsupervised Sentiment Analysis: Analyze work and performance through different aspects and factors under various domains based on feedback.

The overall aim of the project is to classify the text based on its polarity score for having a better impact on connect info and perspective feedback review system.



## IMPACT

The impact of introducing sentiment analysis in perspective data helps users to understand about themselves and improve their skills by enabling one self to write thoughtful feedback and also evaluate oneâ€™s feedback.

a) Sentence Level Supervised Sentiment Analysis: help users to classify the feedback provided into +/- category with its polarity score to analyze their performance. 

b) Aspect Level Supervised Sentiment Analysis: help users to get the aspect scores of their feedbacks to analyze their weak and strong domain.

c) Unsupervised Sentiment Analysis: help users to analyze work and performance through different aspects and factors under various domains based on feedback.

Helpful to analyze the weak part and strong part of an employee.

Useful to generate a performance report of an employee based on feedbacks.

Helpful for a user to understand where the effort is missing and where to continue with the same pace based on his/her feedbacks.

The work can also be extended to other cognitive services under the text classification domain.
